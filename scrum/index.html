the high performance computing storage group.  I've been using the scrum agile
framework for many years to develop software so Mrs. Warnes asked me to come
and explain how you can use it when developing your software.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="1" id="presentation" data-x="2000" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="presentation">Presentation</h1><p>This presentation is available on my website at:

Scrum is a lightweight,
iterative, and incremental framework for managing complex work. It does not
follow the traditional sequential approach of the waterfall model Mrs. Warnes
explained to you last week. It attempts to resolve the issues with the
waterfall development model by recognizing that customers change their mind
about about what they want or need and that there will be unpredictable
challenges during development. While we talking about scrum in the context of
software development, scrum can (and is) used outside of software development.
Also, scrum is only one of many agile frameworks but it is one of the most
popular.</p><p>The people shown in the diagram represent the different roles in scrum.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="3" id="roles" data-x="2000" data-y="1100" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-z="0"><h1 id="scrum-roles">Scrum Roles</h1><ul><li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Represents the business stakeholders.<ul><li>Adds items to the product backlog.</li><li>Prioritizes the product backlog.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Servant-leader.<ul><li>Removes impediments.</li><li>Facilitates team events.</li><li>Buffer between the team and distracting influences.</li><li>Coaches team on Scrum practices.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Development Team</strong>: People who carry out the tasks to build increments of

software. He or she is responsible for working with the business people to
determine things like funding, schedule, and priorities and communicates the
scrum team's status to management. The product owner is the one responsible
for maintaining the product backlog. The product backlog is a prioritized list
of work to be done and is the list of product requirements.</p><p>The scrum master is a person who helps the scrum team to complete their work
and follow the scrum process. The scrum master is not a manager in charge of
the development team but a leader who is a servant to the team. The scrum
master role is usually handled by a program or project manager who has been
certified in the scrum process. Their job is to remove impediments (things
that are preventing the team from completing their work). They also
schedule the various team events like the sprint planning meeting, daily
standup meetings, sprint demo, and sprint retrospective.</p><p>The development team are the people who actually do the tasks required to
create increments of functionality which add value to the product. An
important thing to note is that the development team is not just the
programmers on the team but it includes architects (who design the structure
of the software), the UI/UX designers (who design the user interface and user
experience of the software), testers, and others who contribute to the
product.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="4" id="process2" data-x="4000" data-y="1100" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-z="0"><img src="images/scrum_process_afa_5000.jpg"></img><div class="notes"><p>At the beginning of the project, the scrum master will work with the product
owner to create the product backlog and will work with the development team to
provide an estimate, in story points, of the complexity of each item (called a
story) in the product backlog so the product owner will be able to better
prioritize the stories. The development team uses a process called planning
poker to come up with an estimate that everyone in the team agrees with. Story
point values can be selected in many ways but a Fibonacci sequence is commonly
used (so values like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13 are commonly used). Usually larger
numbers are indications that the feature is too complex and needs to be broken
down into smaller features.</p><p>One of the key features of scrum is that work is done in small increments of
time called a sprint. The actual length of time used for the sprint varies
based on the type of software being developed and the industry it is in.
An e-commerce site might have weekly sprints while safety critical software
may have sprints which last months. Longer sprints are less desirable since
they increase the time for feedback which allows the team to ensure they are
building the software the business needs. The idea is that at the end of each
sprint, the team will have written and tested some new functionality to the
product.</p><p>At the start of a sprint, the product owner, the scrum master, and the
development team will meet in a sprint planning meeting. In that meeting, the
development team will pull features from the top of the product backlog into
the sprint backlog and decompose them into small units of work called tasks
which can be completed within the sprint. The development team will estimate
the amount of hours it will take to complete a task and will continue to pull
items off the product backlog so long as they believe they can get the work
done within the sprint. This is the time for the development team to ask the
product owner any questions necessary to ensure they understand what is
required to complete a story.</p><p>Once the sprint starts, members in the development team will work on tasks
they are capable of completing. The individuals in the team decide which tasks
they want to work on. The scrum master and the product owner don't have any
say in this. Each day, the entire teams meets together in standup meeting,
which is a short meeting (usually less than 15 minutes) where everyone is
standing and, one by one, each of the developers indicates what they did
yesterday, what they plan to do today, and if they have any impediments (i.e.,
things preventing them from being able to work). The scrum master records all
of the impediments so he or she can work to resolve them, outside of the
meeting. Selecting who goes first is often done by who shows up in the room
last. Note that it is important that the meeting starts on time each day.
Sometimes, there are penalties for being late. It depends on the team. The
idea of the standup meeting is for the product owner to get a status update on
how the sprint is progressing, let the scrum master know of any impediments
that are slowing the sprint down, allow engineers to know if someone needs
help with a task, and to provide some accountability to your peers.</p><p>When all of the tasks for a given story are completed, the development team
will mark the story as completed. Tasks for a story should include writing
unit and acceptance tests to ensure the feature is working properly. Teams
may work multiple stories in parallel or may work on all of the tasks for a
single story in parallel. It is up to the team. The burn down or burn up chart
shows the progress of the development team in completing tasks and stories.
The chart is usually updated in real-time and made publicly available so
everyone can see how the sprint is going.</p><p>At the end of the sprint, the development team demonstrates the new
functionality to the product owner in a sprint review. The product owner will
accept any stories which they agree are finished and will reject any stories
which they do not agree are finished. This is one of the reasons it is
important to agree in the sprint planning meeting on what done means for a
story. Rejected stories go back onto the product backlog. While a sprint
should finish all stories on the sprint backlog, it sometimes happens, for
various reasons, that not all stories are completed. Such a sprint is called
a failed sprint.</p><p>It is important to note that the product owner can decide to release the
software after the sprint is completed or they can decide to wait until more
functionality has been added in future sprints. Completed stories should
always be production ready.</p><p>After the sprint review, the team gets together in a sprint retrospective and
discusses what went well during the sprint, what didn't go well, and what the
plans are to try and improve the process. Typically there are 3 items of each
but there is no prescribed number. The important thing here is to continually
be improving the process so future sprints will go better. Example items to
improve can be things like training for the team on a tool or technology or
getting equipment that is needed to improve productivity.</p><p>The sprint cycle then repeats itself.</p><p>Note that during a sprint, the product owner and scrum master should be
working on adding new items to the backlog and reprioritizing items. When new
stories are added, the development team needs to do the planning poker to
estimate the complexity of the story.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="5" id="manifesto" data-x="0" data-y="2200" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-z="0"><h1 id="manifesto-for-agile-software-development">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h1><p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping
